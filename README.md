# An Extension and Correction to the Illuminative Adaptive Transformer
This is the abstract and introduction for a research paper on the Illuminative-Adaptive Transformer (IAT) model for low-light image enhancement. 

Our paper proposes an extension to the IAT model, which is a neural network specifically designed for enhancing low-light images. 

We provide optimizations to the IAT model and extend the pipeline to improve the contrast enhancement results. The IAT model originally used mean absolute error as a loss function and Adam optimization, but we suggest that there are better options in the literature that lead to better enhancement performance. 

We discusses the importance of image enhancement in computer vision and the challenges associated with enhancing low-light images. We also discuss their methodology and results in improving the performance of the IAT model.
