# An Extension and Correction to the Illuminative Adaptive Transformer
This is the abstract and introduction for a research paper on the Illuminative-Adaptive Transformer (IAT) model for low-light image enhancement. 

The paper proposes an extension to the IAT model, which is a neural network specifically designed for enhancing low-light images. 

The authors provide optimizations to the IAT model and extend the pipeline to improve the contrast enhancement results. The IAT model originally used mean absolute error as a loss function and Adam optimization, but the authors suggest that there are better options in the literature that lead to better enhancement performance. 

The paper discusses the importance of image enhancement in computer vision and the challenges associated with enhancing low-light images. The authors also discuss their methodology and results in improving the performance of the IAT model.
